# AOCL-LibM

AOCL-LibM is a high-performant implementation of LibM, the standard C library of basic floating-point mathematical functions. It includes many of the functions from the C99 standard. Single and double precision versions of the functions are provided, all optimized for accuracy and performance, including a small number of complex functions. There are also a number of vector and fast scalar variants provided, in which a small amount of the accuracy has been traded for greater performance.

A list of the scalar functions present in the library is provided below. Note that an “f” at the end of the function name indicates that it is single-precision; otherwise, it is double-precision. They can be called by a standard C99 function call and naming convention and must be linked with AOCL-LibM before standard libm. 

For example:

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/path/to/AOCL-LibM_library
    $ clang -Wall -std=c99 myprogram.c -o myprogram –L<Path to AOCL-LibM Library> -lalm -lm
    Or
    $ gcc -Wall -std=c99 myprogram.c -o myprogram –L<Path to AOCL-LibM Library> -lalm -lm
