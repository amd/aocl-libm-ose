* AMDLIBM Directory Structure

** Skeleton (top level)

- doc - All realtive documentation should go here
- include - All headers relavent for sources
- src - All sources
- gtests - All tests
- utils - Any necessary utilities
- scripts - Scripts necessary for building
- examples - Example test applications

** Documentation

Mostly recides under 'doc/' folder.

doc/internal - is internal reference only.

doc/user - User manual, software developers manual etc. Released externally

** Source

Contains following directories

src/
   optmized/          - Contains optimized C implementations.
   arch/              - Contains architecture specific (zen2/zen3) implementations.
   ref/               - mostly reference implementations.
   kern/              - Kernel variants.
   isa/avx/           - AVX only source.
   isa/avx/gas/       - Assembly only files for GNU ASsembler (128-bit instructions)
   isa/fma4/          - FMA4 (Buldozer) specific
   isa/avx/gas/       - FMA4 (Buildozer) specific hand-optimized assembly
   isa/avx2/          - AVX2 only source.
   isa/avx2/gas/      - Assembly only files for GNU ASsembler (256-bit version)
   isa/avx512/        - AVX512 only source.
   isa/avx512/gas/    - Assembly only files for GNU ASsembler (AVX512 version)

*** Naming convention
v4s - Vector single precision 128-bit (4 32-bit elements)
v8s - Vector single-precision packed 256-bit (8 32-bit elements)
v2d - Vector double-precision packed 128-bit (2 64-bit elements)
v4d - Vector double-precision packed 256-bit (4 64-bit elements)


** Tests

Test Framework files are located directly under the 'gtests/' folder.

gtests/
     include/      - test related headers only.
     libs/         - contains external libraries necessary for testing
     libs/mparith  - Contains the high precision mparith libraries used for Accuracy testing.
     gapi/         - Contains the google libs which are used to exercise gtests and gbench(Performance testing)
     exp/          - exp() related tests
     dynamic/      - Dynamic loading tests.
     compat/       - Glibc libmvec compat layer tests.

** Build Scripts

Build system scripts are located in scripts/site_scons/

site_scons/
    alm/       - Contains ALM building scripts
    site_tools/ - Versioning related scripts
