    Software to any human readable form.  All rights in and to the Materials
    not expressly granted to Licensee in this Agreement are reserved to AMD.

2.  FEEDBACK:  Licensee may provide AMD feedback, suggestions or opinions as to

nationals of countries subject to national security controls as provided in
License Exception TSR of the Export Administration Regulations and any
successor regulations.

12. SEVERABILITY:  Should any term of this Agreement be declared void or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such declaration shall
have no effect on the remaining terms hereof.

13. NO WAIVER:  The failure of either party to enforce any rights granted
hereunder or to take action against the other party in the event of any breach
hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver by that party as to subsequent
