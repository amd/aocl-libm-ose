legal agreement ("Agreement") between you (either an individual or an entity)
("Licensee") and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ("AMD"). If Licensee does not
agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not install or use this software or
any portion thereof.  By loading or using the object code version only of the
software obtained herewith, which may include associated install scripts and
online or electronic documentation or any portion thereof, that is made

all of the terms of this Agreement.

1.  LICENSE:

    a.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, AMD grants

    otherwise transfer the Materials, in whole or in part, to third parties for
    commercial or for non-commercial use; or (ii) modify, disassemble, reverse
    engineer, or decompile the Software, or otherwise reduce any part of the
    Software to any human readable form.  All rights in and to the Materials
    not expressly granted to Licensee in this Agreement are reserved to AMD.

2.  FEEDBACK:  Licensee may provide AMD feedback, suggestions or opinions as to
the Software, its features, and desired enhancements or changes.  If Licensee

provide maintenance, correction, modification, enhancement, or upgrades to the
Materials.  If AMD determines, in its sole discretion, to support, maintain,
correct, modify, enhance, or upgrade the Software, such support, maintenance,
correction, modification, enhancement or upgrade shall be considered part of
the Materials, and shall be subject to this Agreement.

9.  SURVIVAL:  Sections 1(b), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 through 14 shall survive any

successor regulations.

12. SEVERABILITY:  Should any term of this Agreement be declared void or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such declaration shall
have no effect on the remaining terms hereof.

13. NO WAIVER:  The failure of either party to enforce any rights granted
hereunder or to take action against the other party in the event of any breach
hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver by that party as to subsequent
