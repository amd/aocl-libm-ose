  Implementation Notes
 * --------------------
 * Signature:
 *   float complex cpowf(float complex x, float complex y)
 *
 *   Let x = a + I*b
 *
 *   Let y = c + I*d
 *
 *   x^y = (a+i*b) ^ (c+i*b)
 *   x^y = (a+i*b)^c + (a+i*b)^(i*b) (1)
 *
 *   Expressing a + i*b in polar form,
 *   a + i*b = r*e^(i*θ) (2) where θ is the argument of the complex number = tan^(-1)⁡(b/a)
 *   and r is the magnitude of the complex number = √(a^2+ b^2 )
 *   Argument of a complex number can be computed using the cargs() function
 *    Magnitude of a complex number can be completed using cabs() function
 *
 *   Substituting (2) in (1) we get,
 *   x^y = (r*e^(i*θ))^c * (r*e^(i*θ))^(i*b)
 *   x^y = r^c * e^(i*θ*c) * r^(i*b) * e^(-θ*b)  as i * i = -1 (3)
 *
 *   r^(i*b)= e^(i*b*ln(r)) (4)
 *   Substituting (4) in (3), we get,
 *   x^y = r^c*e^(i*θ*c) * e^(i*b*ln⁡(r))*e^(-θ *b)
 *   x^y = r^c*e^(-θ*b) * e^(i* θ*c*b*ln(r))   (5)
 *   Let theta =  θ*c*b*ln(r)
 *   Substituting for theta in (5),
 *   x^y = r^c*e^(-θ*b)* e^(i*theta) (6)
 *
 *   e^(i*theta) = cos(theta) + i * sin(theta) (7)
 *   Substituting for (7) in (6), we get
     x^y = r^c*e^(-θ*b)*(cos⁡(theta)+i*sin⁡(theta
