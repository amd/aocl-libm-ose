 ******************************************
 * Implementation Notes
 * ----------------------
 * To compute vrs8_tanhf(v_f32x8_t x)
 * Split the 8-element vector into two 4-element vectors
 * For each 4-element vector, call vrs4_tanhf
 *
 * vrs4_tanhf works as follows:
 * Let y = |x|
 * If 0 <= y < 0x1.154246p3
 *    Let z = e^(-2.0 * y) - 1      -(1)
 *
 *    Using (1), tanhf(y) can be calculated as,
 *    tanhf(y) = -z / (z + 2.0)
 *
 * For other cases, call scalar tanhf()
 *
 * If x < 0, then we use the identity
 *       tanhf(-x) = -tanhf(x)
 *
 * Max ULP of current implementation: 1
 *
