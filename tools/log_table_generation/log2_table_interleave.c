Program to generate interleaved look-up tables for log function

The head and tail tables are calculated as follows:

  Let table_size be the number of values required in the look-up tables
  The values of log(1 + ( j / table_size)), where j ranges from 0 to table_size,
        is stored as two tables - head and tail for maintaing precision

  First, the log value is calculated in extra precision using libquadmath as
  quadlog = logq (1 + ( j / table_size))
  Then, the least significant 16 bits for scalar log of the value quadlog are masked, which gives the head value
  i.e, head = quadlog & BITS_MASK

  Then, the tail value is calculated as,
   tail = quadlog - head

  libquadmath is used for getting the required precision

This program can be used to interleave Head and tail tables alone.
